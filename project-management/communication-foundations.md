Project Management Foundations: Communication - LinkedIn Learning

1. The Communication Plan

Project Communication
	The way you communicate should depend on your audience.
	Audience Groups
		Stakeholders
			People affected by the project
		Supporters
			People who help you complete your project
		Spectators
			People interested in the project but not directly impacted

	Audience List
		Cols: Group, Role, Name, Title, Method (of communication), Contact Email, Contact Phone
	


Plan the Communication
	How much does your stakeholder need to know about your project?
	Who is the audience and what do they need to know? Why?

	Stakeholder Communication Plan (Easier to organize and easy to follow)
		Focus on the who
		Includes Audience List
	Event Communication Plan
		Focuses on the how
		List of meetings, reports and email blasts
	
	Stakeholder Register
	Stakeholder Plan
		Which stakeholders?
		How will they receive it?
		What will it say?
		When?
	
	Keep it updated


2. How We Communicate

Encoding and Decoding Messages
	Evaluating communication
		Motivation?
		What is the intended action?
		Are there alternative meanings?	
	Content
	Circumstances
	Context
	

One-Way Communication
	Sending information in messages that won't instantly be received or generate responses
	Only use it for low-emotion messages
	
	Adress questions about your one-way message with two-way communication


Two-Way Communication
	Sending information to someone in a way that allows instant response by the message recipient	
	Best form is face-to-face communication
	Reserve one-way communication for notifications
	Best practices
		Focus on listening
		Mind physical obstacles
		Separate what you hear from what you want to hear


Active Listening
	Rinsing
		Remove what is not relevant
	Remixing
		Synthesize what you heard
	Rewording
		Reword it back to them	

	Avoid talking about other topics
	Ask clear questions to avoid misinterpretations


Formal Communication
	Formal messages
	Each type of communication has a type of assumption

	Think about
		People
		Message

	Messages that are consequential should always be sent using formal communication
		Written
		Verbal

Informal Communication
	Majority of the communication
	Communication that is not prepared
	It is easier to ask question

	Can lead to unfiltered communication
	MBWA (Management By Walking Around)
	
	Be accessible for chats
	Be friendly and interested in solving problems


3. Communicate with Stakeholders

Categorize the Stakeholders
	Stakeholder
		Someone who believes that the project affects them
	Stakeholder management plan
		Categorize them. Not as individual, but as roles
	P3I Technique
		Power
		Impact
		Interest
		Influence
	

Prioritize the Stakeholders
	There will be a lot of "ASAP"
	Do a table 2x2 with power on the y (low at the bottom, high at the top) and interest at the x (low at the left, high at the right) 
	Stakeholder registry
		Low P Low I is "Monitor"
		Low P High I is "Inform"
		High P Low I is "Keep Satisfied"
		High P High I is "Manage Closely"


Manage Executive Stakeholders
	Executive-Friendly Language
		1. Understand key motivators
		2. Be concise
		3. Understand the big picture

	1. Understand Key Motivators
		Quality and Delivery
	2. Be concise
		Elevator pitch


Answer Tough Questions
	NIECE
		Never get upset
		Illustrate their question with examples
		Empathize with the stakeholder
		Clarify the question
		Explain your answer
	

Cross-Functional Communication
	A group of employees from different functional areas.
	Shared language. 
	

4. Project Meetings

Why We Meet
	Conference meetings don't do well.
	Bainstorming meetings max of 7 people. 


Meeting Management
	Many times, people are in meetings but don't know why they are there
	SHARKS. 
		State the agenda
		Hijackers are to be managed
		Add relevant information
		Repeat the agenda at the end
		Keep it small and short
		Schedule outside of the meeting
	
	State the agenda
		Should be really clear. Time and reasons of the meeting.
	Hijackers are to be managed
		Only treat what should be treated in the meeting
	Add relevant information
		No one should talk if not adding relevant information
	Repeat the agenda at the end
	Keep it small and short
	Schedule outside of the meeting
		There's no need to take everyone's time


5. Project Reports

Decide What to Include
	Writing concise reports
		Use minimum language
		Use active voice
		Use bullet points


Clear Language
	1. Spit
		Write everything
		Don't edit
		Go away for a moment and think abt something else
	2. Polish
		Reread
		Organize
		Create flow
			Consider your audience
		Walk away again
	3. Shine 
		Tighten
		Filter


Simple Charts
	A smiley face is a good way to show a good outcome. A lightbulb shows an idea. 
	Keep reports brief, so using sketches is a really good way to communicate more with less.
