INTRO  
MANAGING REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCCESSFUL PROJECTS  
    In simple terms, what the project needs.

DEFINING REQUIREMENTS: KEY QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER  
    1. Who are the stakeholders?  
    2. What do our stakeholders need?  
    3. How important is each requirement?  
    4. How will we deal with issues?

MANAGE PROJECT REQUIREMENTS CHALLENGES  
    High level challenges are always the same. Consider the questions mentioned before.

1. USING THE REQUIREMENTS MANAGEMENT PROCESS

A TEN-STEP PROJECT REQUIREMENTS CHECKLIST  
    - Identify standards  
    - Develop an elicitation plan  
    - Identify stakeholders  
    - Gather project requirements  
    - Analyze requirements  
    - Prioritize requirements  
    - Create use cases  
    - Document project requirements  
    - Approve project requirements  
    - Manage changes to requirements

IDENTIFY STANDARDS  
    ISO 21500 â€“ Guidance on project management  
    Requirements Discovery and Analysis Workshops  
        JAD Joint Application Design  
        JRP Joint Requirements Planning  
        JAR Joint Application Requirements

PREPARE THE ELICITATION PLAN  
    Elicitation means data gathering.  
    Could be interviews or watching people work and documenting what you observe. Also analyzing data.

IDENTIFY THE STAKEHOLDERS  
    We need to identify who they are and what they need.  
    Sponsor, customers, finance team, etc.  
    Understand their influence.

GATHER PROJECT REQUIREMENTS  
    Match our data gathering techniques with our data sources.  
    What will determine this project's success.  
    1. Capture exact words  
    2. Ask follow-up questions  
    3. Take and summarize notes  
    4. Be ready for changes

ANALYZE REQUIREMENTS  
    Document/track data.  
    Attributes to consider:  
        - Absolute reference  
        - Complexity  
        - Risk  
        - Author  
        - Source  
        - Ownership  
        - Stability  
        - Urgency  
        - Priority  
        - State

PRIORITIZE PROJECT REQUIREMENTS  
    Ensure all requirements are unique  
    Review requirement complexity  
    Level of importance:  
        - Necessary  
        - Optional

CREATE USE CASES  
    How the solution should work once complete  
    Actors  
        People and systems included in a use case  
    Actions or Events  
        The steps in completing a use case  
    UML

DOCUMENT PROJECT REQUIREMENTS  
    - Executive summary  
    - Background information  
    - Stakeholder list  
    - Project goals  
    - Scope  
    - Risks  
    - Interdependencies  
    Glossary  
        Key terms and definitions  
    Requirements

            Solution 1  
        Req. 2  
            Solution 2  
        ...  
    1. Clear and specific  
    2. Thorough detail  
    3. Testable

APPROVE PROJECT REQUIREMENTS  
    1. Stakeholder review  
    2. Management approval
